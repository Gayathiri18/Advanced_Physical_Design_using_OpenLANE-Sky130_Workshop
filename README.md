# Advanced_Physical_Design_using_OpenLANE-Sky130_Workshop
Workshop on Advanced_Physical_Design_using_OpenLANE-Sky130

Place and route in complex VLSI design involves placing the cells and connecting them to meet the design power, performance, and area (PPA) goals.
This workshop contains SoC design planning in Openlane flow using the latest Google-SkyWater 130nm process node.
Aim of this workshop:
*Design and characterize your own standard cell.
*Have a hands-on in the Physical Design domain.
*Generate a full GDSII from a RTL netlist.
*Explore and contribute to open source EDA world.
